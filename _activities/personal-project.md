Continue my ISEF project
In my spare time, I continue following my passion, computer graphics by making game engine (OpenGL, Vulkan, etc) and continue building, engineering my software of performing reconstructing 3D internal anatomies with realistic physical-based simulation (e.h blood fluid, cell movement, etc). Enjoy doing it.
