**June to December 2024**
- Conducted research and engineering in the field of computer vision. Explored this [repository](https://github.com/kyle-paul/computer-vision) for details. The research journey spanned from the [history of computer vision](https://github.com/kyle-paul/computer-vision/tree/master/cvdl/dnns) (e.g., MobileNet, GoogleNet, DenseNet, ResNet, RepVGG) to [modern advancements](https://github.com/kyle-paul/computer-vision/tree/master/sam) like SAM, DINOv2, DETR, and GANs.  
- Investigated image and video retrieval methods, focusing on multimodal feature extraction. Developed and deployed a [retrieval system](https://github.com/kyle-paul/AI-Challenge-HCMUS) on both local servers and AWS cloud. See this paper ["Multimodal Contextualized Support for Enhancing Video Retrieval System"](/research/paper-2) for more details.
- Gained expertise with Docker for efficient engineering workflows. Deployed ONNX models on various [backends](https://github.com/kyle-paul/accelerated-performance) such as TensorRT and OpenVINO. Deployed and served AI models using tools like [Triton Inference Server](https://github.com/kyle-paul/triton) and FastAPI.
