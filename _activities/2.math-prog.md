**From August 2024, until now**
- I have a deep passion for mathematics and informatics, which I continue to pursue after [this competition](/talks/informatics) by tackling challenging problems and contests on platforms like Codeforces and LeetCode.  
- Additionally, participating in numerous [PIMA events](/talks/pima) has allowed me to immerse myself in the beauty of "hard" and pure mathematics, enriching my understanding and appreciation for the subject.
