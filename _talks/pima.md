I participated in PIMA, a summer camp organized by Gold Medalist IMO Can Tran Thanh Trung. During the camp, I had the opportunity to meet inspiring teachers, teaching assistants, and talented peers who share a passion for mathematics. We studied Calculus, Linear Algebra, and Linear Programming. On the final day of the camp, we were given three days to conduct in-depth research on a specific topic and present our findings. Our assigned topic was Combinatorics on Graphs. This topic includes integer linear programming (ILP), domatic number, and hypercube, which initially seemed challenging, but we successfully completed the project with a slide presentation and a report (see below).

In addition, I volunteered at several PIMA events, with the Math Open Day being the highlight. I took on the role of Puzzle Solver, where I created problems at five different difficulty levels for participants to solve. It was a memorable experience, filled with fun and a shared love for mathematics.
