I frequently give presentations on various topics at SeLAB. Recently, I focused on two main subjects: video retrieval and computer graphics. Below are two slides I used to present additional work or background knowledge to my colleagues in the lab, similar to a seminar format. Afterward, they engage with questions and discussions on the topic. Note: The information on the slides may not be entirely accurate, as I am still in the process of learning and improving.
