This post serves as a record of my activities, experiences, and achievements, including prize and honor certificates. [*view details*](/posts/algo)

I discovered my love for programming during the summer of 9th grade, starting with website development. In high school, I attended Artificial Intelligence classes offered at my school, which marked the beginning of my AI learning journey. From the very first lecture, I was captivated by how the material was thoughtfully designed to be accessible to high school students.

I also took on the role of a Teaching Assistant for a Python class, helping other students learn more effectively. Now, with experience from various competitions, I have taken on a mentoring role, advising students who want to work on projects or participate in VISEF/ISEF competitions.
