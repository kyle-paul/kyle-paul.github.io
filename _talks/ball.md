This post serves as a record of my activities, experiences, and achievements, including prize and honor certificates. [*view details*](/posts/basketball)

I started playing basketball in 6th grade, driven by my passion for the sport. I first joined the District 10 team and later earned a spot on the city’s selected team in 9th grade, all while excelling academically. During that time, I won a bronze medal at the city-level basketball championship, secured second prize in a city-level specialized English competition, and graduated secondary school as the top student.

Basketball not only fueled my passion but also helped me improve academically, teaching me valuable skills in time management and balancing priorities. At Le Hong Phong High School for the Gifted, I became the team leader in 11th grade. With my team, we achieved second place at the city-level championship, and I was often recognized as the best player in nearly every competition I participated in.

Over the years, I’ve earned numerous gold, silver, and bronze medals across various leagues while maintaining excellent academic performance and pursuing my passion for technology and research. Playing sports has been a vital tool for keeping my mind refreshed and improving my productivity. Additionally, I have organized several basketball charity leagues to raise funds for charitable causes, combining my love for the game with a commitment to giving back.
