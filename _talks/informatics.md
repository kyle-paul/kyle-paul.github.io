In 11th grade, I discovered my passion for computer science and competitive programming. The thrill of solving a problem and achieving an "Accepted" verdict was unmatched. I enrolled in several courses on the subject and ranked 4th in my class overall. Encouraged by this, I joined my high school’s informatics team. After months of learning and competing with friends, I earned the opportunity to participate in the city-level computer science competition.

Unfortunately, I couldn’t solve the final problem out of three and ended up securing 3rd place. Despite this setback, my passion for algorithms remained strong. I continued honing my skills on various online platforms like Codeforces, VNOI, and LeetCode, enjoying the challenge of tackling complex problems.
