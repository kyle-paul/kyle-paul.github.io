This hackathon consisted of three rounds. In the first round, contestants were tasked with independently building an AI-integrated application (using computer vision or NLP) to address a societal problem. My project, [Skin Disease Detector](https://github.com/kyle-paul/Skin-Disease-Detector), was recognized as one of the top 5 projects in this round.

In the second round, contestants from various regions across the country were randomly grouped into teams. Together, we collaborated to develop and launch a tech product. The final round was a live competition where we had to rapidly finalize our project, meet strict deadlines, and respond to judges' questions and concerns. 

As the lead developer and team leader, I guided my team in creating a web application dedicated to mental health support - [TedUp](https://github.com/kyle-paul/TedUP). Details of the project can be found here. Ultimately, from nearly 50 teams nationwide, our team proudly secured the 1st prize.
