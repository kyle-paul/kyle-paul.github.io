I am a student with a passion for computing, mathematics, and science. My [current research](/research/work-1) focuses on the intersection of **computer graphics** and **computer vision**, exploring its applications in medical imaging, surgical simulation, robotics, physical simulation, and synthetic data. I enjoy applying mathematical and **physically-based modeling** to develop my own [3D simulation graphics engine - **Vortex**](https://github.com/kyle-paul/Vortex).
